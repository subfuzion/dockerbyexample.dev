## Get prerequisites

**Docker**

You can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. See
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

**Curl or Postman**

We'll only demonstrate using command-line [curl](https://curl.se/download.html)
for testing server requests, but you can also
use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), a handy graphical tool, if
you prefer.

### Use Cloud Shell

Instead of installing Docker on your machine, you can use [Cloud
Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell).

Docker is preinstalled along with all the other tools you'll need (and more)
for this guide, such as `git`,
`curl`, and an integrated development environment (IDE), including editor and
terminal. Try it in your browser:

https://ide.cloud.google.com/

## Get the examples

Clone the [examples
repo](https://github.com/subfuzion/dockerbyexample.dev-examples) and change
directory into it.

```text
git clone https://github.com/subfuzion/dockerbyexample.dev-examples.git
cd dockerbyexample.dev-examples
```
