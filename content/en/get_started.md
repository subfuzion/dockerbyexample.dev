## Get Docker

You can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. See
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Use Cloud Shell

Instead of installing Docker on your machine, you can use [Cloud
Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell).

Docker is preinstalled along with a bunch of other tools, such as `git` and an
integrated editor and terminal, that you can use to get up and running quickly.
Try the IDE in your browser:

https://ide.cloud.google.com/

## Get the examples

Clone the [examples
repo](https://github.com/subfuzion/dockerbyexample.dev-examples) and change
directory into it.

```text
git clone https://github.com/subfuzion/dockerbyexample.dev-examples.git
cd dockerbyexample.dev-examples
```
