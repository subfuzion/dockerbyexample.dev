If you're the kind of developer who learns best by doing, then this guide is for
you. Rather than learning Docker by focusing on CLI commands, this guide focuses
on learning how to author Dockerfiles to run programs in containers.

Starting with simple examples, you'll become familiar with important Dockerfile
instructions and learn relevant CLI commands as you go.

The pace is quick and explanations are succinct, but this guide will get you up
and running with a solid foundation in professional Docker best practices.

See [Getting Started](getting-started) in the next section to prepare for
running the examples on your own.
